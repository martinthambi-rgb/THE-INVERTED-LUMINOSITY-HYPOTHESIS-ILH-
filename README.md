## 📘 Description
The **Inverted Luminosity Hypothesis (ILH)** proposes that the dark sector of the Universe is fully luminous within its own spectrum, invisible to baryonic observers due to orthogonal coupling.  
Luminosity is an **observer-relative property**, not an intrinsic one. ILH redefines cosmic darkness as **perceptual exclusion**, restoring symmetry to universal visibility and suggesting that both baryonic and dark domains may be mutually luminous within their respective coupling frameworks.  
The paper formalizes the **Inverted Luminosity Theorem**, exploring hidden-sector gauge symmetries, kinetic mixing, topological segregation, and empirical implications across gravitational lensing, portal events, and haloscope detection.  
Developed by *Martin Thambi* in collaboration with **AI systems Grok (xAI)** and **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**, ILH merges theoretical physics, cosmology, and philosophy into a single relational framework of **reciprocal luminosity**.

## 🧠 Abstract (Extended)
The ILH formalizes luminosity as a coupling-defined property between emitter and observer sectors. Two radiative manifolds—baryonic (Σᴮ) and dark (Σᴰ)—possess near-zero overlap, creating reciprocal invisibility while remaining gravitationally unified.  
This reframing transforms the 95:5 cosmic asymmetry into a **symmetry of perception**, suggesting a Universe that is fully radiant yet partitioned by interaction geometry.
